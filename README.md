# Neural Network music generator

## Inspiration:

Sample output with far less data - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0cAy3-vryo.
WaveNet group results. Single and multi instrument generated music. https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/.

## Resources:

Wavenet: https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet

GRUV: https://github.com/MattVitelli/GRUV

Dataset: Downloaded mixes of low-fi hip hop from YouTube and SoundCloud. 

## Goals of the project:

The goal of this project is to create a program that produces low-fi hip hop music generated by a WaveNet model that is trained on at least 1500 tracks. 

## Steps in the project:

1. Download tracks.
2. Trim tracks that have multiple songs or exceed 30 mins in length. 
3. Convert tracks from .mp3 to .wav
4. Store tracks in S3.
5. Install all necessary software onto AWS virtual machine, and train WaveNet model on our S3 data with p2.xlarge GPU. 
6. Generate output.
Extra: Make playlist with output and upload to YouTube and SoundCloud. 
7. Extract insight once we have generated output to talk about in presentation.

## Current progress

2/19/19

So far, we have collected all the data we want to use, trimmed it, and converted it to the necessary file formay (.wav). We have set up an EC2 instance with a p2.xlarge GPU. Right now we are uploading the full data set into S3 but it will take a few hours. We expect to have generated some output by Friday.
